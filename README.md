# Complex-Numbers-Project2LabP

In this project, a base was created that manipulates polynomials with complex coefficients. 

The ADTs Complex and Polynomial were implemented, concretizing the classes ComplexConcrete.java and PolynomialVector.java.
 
The behavior of the methods to be implemented is documented in the javadoc of the interfaces, and is also inferred through the expected output of the execution of RunProject2 as well as the expected results through the execution of the JUnit tests.

Made with Java
